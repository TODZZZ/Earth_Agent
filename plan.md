# Google Earth Engine Agent - Project Plan

Based on your requirements, here's a structured plan for developing the Google Earth Engine Agent Chrome extension:

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Architecture
1. Set up a Chrome extension project with Vite.js (recommended for better build performance)
2. Configure the basic extension manifest and structure
3. Create the sidebar UI skeleton with login component
4. Set up the agent framework using LangChain.js and LangGraph.js

## Phase 2: MVP Implementation
1. Implement basic chat interface
2. Create core agent framework with simplified Planner agent
3. Implement Database Search tool to access GEE catalog
4. Build Code Generation agent with basic functionality
5. Create content script to interact with GEE code editor

## Phase 3: Full Agent System Development
1. Complete all agent implementations (Planner, Database Selector, Code Generator, Debugger, Summarizer)
2. Develop remaining tools (Code Run, Inspect, Console, Task, Script Edit)
3. Implement RAG system for GEE API documentation
4. Add error handling and debugging capabilities

## Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
1. Refine UI/UX based on testing
2. Optimize agent workflows and interactions
3. Add authentication with Google accounts
4. Implement caching and performance optimizations

## Suggested Improvements:
1. Consider adding a visualization feedback loop where the agent can evaluate the rendered map
2. Implement a history feature to save past interactions and generated maps
3. Add export functionality to save generated code or maps
4. Include a tutorial mode for new users

Would you like me to proceed with implementing Phase 1 to set up the project structure?
